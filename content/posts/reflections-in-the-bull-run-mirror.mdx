during the 2024 crypto bull run, i saw sides of us that i wish i hadn’t. there was this raw, unfiltered greed and a dash of fakeness that seemed to permeate the air. back in the quieter days, we talked a big game about changing the world—decentralization, democracy, all those big, shiny ideals. we were going to build something that mattered, something that stood for freedom and rights and all that good stuff. but then the money started rolling in, and it felt like all those grand plans just... evaporated.

it’s hard not to get a bit cynical, you know? watching everyone, myself included, get caught up in the frenzy of it all. the dream of overnight riches seemed to overshadow everything we said we stood for. i can't help but feel a bit disillusioned. it’s like we all forgot who we were the moment the dollar signs appeared. makes you wonder if those ideals were ever real, or just convenient stories we told ourselves to feel like part of something bigger.

i’ve had moments of just staring at myself, not liking what i saw. it’s a weird mix of disappointment and a sort of resignation. like, is this what we’re all about? chasing the next big score, forgetting our values the moment they’re inconvenient? it feels like, at our core, we’re just wired for this—greed, selfishness, forgetting the bigger picture.

but, even with all this bitterness, i can't shake off this stubborn thread of hope. maybe it's naive, but i believe in second chances, in learning from our mess-ups. this whole rollercoaster has been a mirror, showing us the best and worst of ourselves. and yeah, the reflection's been pretty harsh at times. but it’s also a chance to really think about who we want to be, beyond the hype and the greed.

amidst the cacophony of voices shouting for instant wealth and market dominance, i found myself branded with a term that, strangely, i've come to embrace—fundamentalist. it was hurled my way during debates on how we should craft an ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), a label meant to critique my insistence on technical rigor over accessible explanations. "make it more technical, expect the reader to understand the code," i argued, believing firmly that the soul of ethereum, its very essence, lies within its code.

you can call me a fundamentalist if you want. i've grown fond of the term, actually. it's become a badge of honor, a testament to my unwavering belief in ethereum's foundational principles. following the EIP's process and conventions doesn't make me a zealot; it anchors me to the very core of what ethereum aspires to be. those who dismiss the technical nature of these proposals, opting instead for the flash and allure of projects like erc404, miss the point entirely. yes, erc404 made waves, but its echo fades in the void left by its lack of substance. its viral fame, a fleeting illusion of success, starkly contrasts with the enduring impact of true innovation. in terms of the discussion about erc404, jtriley.eth's [tweet](https://twitter.com/jtriley_eth/status/1763981954582528275) was a good summary of the situation.

to those entangled in the spectacle of business triumphs, i pose a quiet reflection: this realm was never solely about business. we ventured into the uncharted territories of blockchain and cryptocurrency not to replicate the world as it is but to reimagine it as it could be. this is about more than "making the world a better place" in the cliched sense. it's about chasing the millennia-old dream of decentralization and freedom, a vision that transcends mere economic gain.

yet, amid this pursuit, i've often found myself disillusioned. the ugliness of greed and short-sighted ambition rears its head, even here, in a space that promised escape from such base human inclinations. i'm wearied by the reality that, despite our high-minded ideals, we are too often dragged down by the lesser angels of our nature.

but even as i navigate my frustration with the contradictions of our community, my commitment to ethereum's ideals remains unshaken. i reject the notion that to be a fundamentalist in this context is to be myopic or resistant to progress. on the contrary, it is to be deeply connected to the project's revolutionary potential, to insist that our advancements carry the weight of our original dreams.

in this light, being labeled a fundamentalist becomes a declaration of my dedication to a future where technology serves humanity's grandest aspirations. it's a commitment to the hard, often unglamorous work of building something truly transformative. yes, i am a fundamentalist, if that means i hold fast to the belief that in the code lies our path to decentralization and freedom. and in this turbulent journey, amid the chaos of bull runs and the fickleness of fame, it's this conviction that guides me—a beacon through the storm, illuminating the way forward, not just for myself, but for all who share this dream.

our quest is a noble one, grounded in the deepest principles of innovation and equity. in the face of disillusionment, let us rekindle our commitment to the cause. for in the end, it is not the critics who shape the world, but those who dare to dream—and build—something different.
