as we bid farewell to the first month of 2024, it dawns on me that 2023 has already become a chapter in the past. time, as always, has a subtle way of slipping through our fingers.

reflecting on the year that has just passed, i realized that each month was a unique story in itself, brimming with moments both grand and mundane. to capture the essence of these fleeting moments, i embarked on a journey through my photo library.

after much contemplation, i have selected one photo for each month from the year 2023. this collection is not just a series of images; it's a rewind and summary of a truly wonderful year.

each photograph is a gateway to a cherished memory, a standout day, or a joyful moment, including glimpses of the times spent with those who mean the world to me. i invite you to join me as i stroll down this memory lane, revisiting the year that was 2023 through the lens of these captured moments.

january sun casts a golden glow over venice, its light dancing on the gentle ripples of the canal where a gondola slips by, a silent sentinel to the day's quiet joys and the warm company of loved one in this city of timeless charm. it's a moment frozen in time, reflecting the joy of togetherness at the year's hopeful dawn.

march brought a celebration of life and sweet indulgence. it's not just a birthday cake; it's a delicious symbol of another year embraced. it's a reminder to live life to the fullest, to savor every moment, and to always make room for dessert.

## april

april marked a significant leap in my professional journey, as i stepped into the world of innovation and gaming with ZeroX gaming. joining as a founding team member of this web3 startup, i hold dear the image of our humble beginnings — a space brimming with potential and the seeds of what's to come. it's an origin we'll always remember, even as we've moved on, a testament to the beginnings that shape our journey ahead.

## may

may marked a personal revolution: the month i welcomed my very first car, a Tesla, into my life. this dream was first ignited back in 2021 during my internship at Tesla, where, as a software engineer, i marveled at the pinnacle of modern technology. now, it's a full-circle moment, with the keys in my hand and the future at my fingertips. it's a reminder that dreams do come true, and that the best is yet to come.

## june

june gifted me a tranquil moment at english bay in Vancouver, the city i call home, where the setting sun painted the sky in strokes of fiery oranges and calm blues. silhouetted figures basked in the dwindling light, a reminder of the simple joys that the end of a day can bring and the beauty of nature that's just a glance away.

## july

july was a crescendo of excitement as i found myself at Twice's concert in Toronto, enveloped in the electric atmosphere only a live performance can invoke. the vip ticket was my golden pass, affording me an intimate view of the stage where each member, an artist in their own right, shone brilliantly. it was a surreal experience, where the music, the energy, and the proximity turned the concert into a living, breathing work of art.

## august

august saw me return to Toronto, a city that was once my home for four years during undergrad, now through the lens of progress and as a representative of Zerox Gaming at a blockchain conference. this skyline, a mix of familiar landmarks and new horizons, symbolizes the blend of my past and future, where the city’s architectural crescendo meets the burgeoning potential of the tech i’m there to champion.

## september

![september](/2023-rewind/9.jpg)

september, amidst the magical backdrop of disneyland, a cherished moment was captured — a photo of a lifetime, one might say, shared with X — marking our reunion months after our european escapades in january. it's an image that radiates the joy and wonder of being in 'the happiest place on earth', symbolizing the carefree spirit and delightful adventures that only such a place can offer.

## october

![october](/2023-rewind/10.jpg)

october, while roaming the streets of Hong Kong, alone to reconnect with family and friends, a thought struck me: sometimes, there's a longing to live within a fantasy, and Hong Kong feels like such a city. although i've never been to Japan, i imagine it shares this quality. it seems all human endeavors are essentially dream-making, varying in scale and style, but at their core, they craft a fantasy to escape the reality of the moment (e.g., animes and Mars colonization). i suspect if i lived in hong kong, my affection for it might wane, similar to my idealized longing for Japan — both are transient fantasies of my own making. on this path of dream-weaving, there's so much more we can do...

## november

![november](/2023-rewind/11.jpg)

november, on the eve of my return to canada, after a soul-enriching two-month journey in China post-graduation, i shared laughter and captured memories in a photo booth with friends — a parting gift that encapsulated the joy of our time together. among these cherished snapshots is the celebration of X's 23rd birthday. these moments, frozen in time, are a vivid reminder of the bonds we've strengthened and the unforgettable experiences that i'll carry with me as i head back to canadian shores.

## december

![december](/2023-rewind/12.jpg)

december, a new chapter began for zerox gaming as we moved into our new office, offering fantastic views of the cityscape and night scenery. on our very first day, we were greeted by the sight of a double rainbow gracing the skyline, a harbinger of good fortune often considered an auspicious sign. as we embark on this new venture, we look forward to the growth and opportunities that await us at our new home.

as i wrap up this photographic journey through the 12 months of 2023, each snapshot serves as a vivid brushstroke on the canvas of my year. from the sunny canals of venice in january to the vibrant streets of hong kong in october, and from the joyous reunions with friends to the inception of zerox gaming's new office, every image holds a cherished memory and a story to tell.

looking back, i realize that life is a collection of these moments, each one a unique blend of emotions, experiences, and milestones. whether it's the quiet contemplation of a chocolate cake in march, the exhilaration of a twice concert in july, or the realization of a dream car in may, these photographs have become more than just pictures; they are windows into my world.

in the midst of life's hustle and bustle, we often forget to pause and appreciate the beauty of these fleeting moments. this photobook, '2023 Rewind,' has allowed me to do just that. it has reminded me of the value of every day, the significance of every experience, and the power of memories to shape our lives.

as i step into the future, i carry with me not only these images but also the lessons and emotions they hold. here's to the year that was 2023, a year of growth, exploration, and heartfelt connections. may the coming years be filled with even more moments worth capturing and cherishing.
