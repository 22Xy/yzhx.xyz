a research paper I wrote during my last year at the uoft 🍁.

though i wasn't aware of it after submitting my paper to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14073), it has now been [cited 14 times](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=1269778983287445087). not very impressive, but considering i'm an engineer and not a researcher, i'm satisfied with that :&#41;. i guess i've left a small mark in this world and helped some people. it's quite interesting to think that when someone conducts similar research in the future, they will read my outcomes and findings 👣.

here is the abstract of the paper:

> Low/No-code development is a software development method that provides users with a platform for visually creating applications with little or no coding. Companies and organizations need software applications and information systems for various business purposes like management in the technology era. Low/No-code development gives non-IT professionals a convenient tool for rapidly building simple business applications they need without or with little coding. In this paper, we explored the benefits & limitations of Low/No-Code development and modern Low/No-Code development platforms in the industry. In addition, we analyzed how it can be improved and prospected the impacts of Low/No-Code development on society and related industries in the future. In conclusion, we find that Low/No-code development is a promising trend that can significantly impact future software development and digital transformation.
