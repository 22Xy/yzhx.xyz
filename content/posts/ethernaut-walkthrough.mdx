this was my introductory tutorial on web3/solidity. i only started learning solidity in august 2022. [this walkthrough](https://0xmacintosh.ca/docs/skill/blockchain/ethereum/ethernaut-walkthrough/) is a compilation of my learning notes and code implementations from when i first began studying solidity and web3 security.

[ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is a web3/solidity-based wargame inspired by [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. the game is 100% open source, and all levels are contributions made by other players.
